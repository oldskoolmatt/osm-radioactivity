Version: 1.1.10
Date: 20. 01. 2022
  Features:
    - Radiation damage and radiation damage decay (from complete rework of Radioactive Contamination)
    - Geiger counter sound is played when a radiation source is within 10 meters radius (can be turned off in settings)
    - Alert sprite starts flashing when a radiation source is within 10 meters radius
    - Hazmat suit which provides some shielding from radiation when worn (reduces damage taken of 80%)
    - Shielded chest which provides complete shielding from any radioactive element contained inside of it
    - Shielded tank which provides complete shielding from any radioactive fluids contained inside of it
    - Show radiation levels on screen (can be toggled on or off via settings)
